<p>The purpose of this Developer Guide is to provide useful information to software developers who desire to contribute to the project (e.g. optimizing of code, adding test cases, etc.), including an overview of the software architecture, design as well as current implementations and intended functionality of current features. The police database is for police officers(PO) and headquarters personnel(HQP). Both groups will have varying access and authorization levels to this database. POs would be able to read from the database after screening someone while on patrol and choose his course of action base on the status/threat level of subject. HQP would have the added functions of adding and removing people from the database. Refer to quick start to get started.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This section describes some of the more important details of certain features implemented.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>1a. Password Feature</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Users and passwords are stored in passwordStorage.txt in the format: USER PASSWORD.
This is to simplify reading the line by splitting the line using the whitespace.
Each user and corresponding password are in stored in one line.
Since each line refers to one user, the reader can loop through each line to check for a specific user and password.
Passwords are stored in hashcoded form so that even if passwordStorage.txt is deleted, the system still cannot be accessed.
Headquarters Personnel have full access to all the commands while Police officers cannot Add, Clear, Check, Delete, Edit nor Update password.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the device is locked, User has to enter a specific password to grant user the level of access requested.
A buffered reader reads through the whole file to match the password entered.
If the password is wrong, the user has 5 attempts left. This number decreases with each wrong password.
The system shuts down after 5 wrong passwords.
This is to ensure that the system denies access to anyone who is not authorized.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The User can enter the lock command at any time to ensure that the device is logged out immediately.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Alternatives considered:
- using an internal hashmap to store user and passwords. Difficult to observe how many POs are there.
- Storing password in plaintext . Passwords can be seen in passwordStorage.txt
- Allowing any number of attempts to unlock device. Can be easily looped to try all passwords.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>1b. Update Password Feature</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Headquarters Personnel can update any stored password with the update password command.
The buffered reader reads the passwordStorage.txt file for the specific password to change.
Once the user has entered a new password, he is prompted to enter the same password again.
This is to ensure that the password typed is accurate.
However, the new password must be alphanumeric and at least 5 characters long.
This is to ensure a strong password.
The print writer then loops over the passwordStorage.txt file and places all existing passwords into a new temporary file, while placing the new password over the old password.
The temporary file is renamed to passwordStorage.txt and the original file containing the old password is deleted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Alternatives considered:
- Update password one time, without secondary prompt to enter password. This will make the changes permanent even if a mistake is made.
- Updating using any password, without validity. Password may be weak.
- Overwriting passwordStorage.txt . This will cause errors in replacing password.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>2a. "find" command (edited)</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The new "find" command is revised from the existing "find" command in AB3. Instead of finding a person by name, it finds a person using his NRIC.
It also implements the following operations:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>execute() - executes the "find" command itself and displays the result to the user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>getPersonWithNric() - Searches the addressbook to retrieve the person with the specified NRIC.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following is an example usage scenario of the "find" command:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 1: The user input his password and unlocks the system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 2: The user executes "find s1234567a" command where the first argument is the command word "find" and the second argument is the NRIC to be
searched, which in this case is "s1234567a" (all letter are lower cased). The "find" command calls execute() which also calls getPersonWithNric() method.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 3: The getPersonWithNric() method searches the addressbook for the person with "s1234567a" if he exists and person is stored in a list.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 4: The person is found and is stored in a matchedPerson list variable. execute() returns a CommandResult using the matchedPerson list as its argument.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 5: The CommandResult object displays to the user the searched person and his details, all of which in string form.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>2b. "check" command</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Only a HQP may use this command. This command displays the timestamps of which a person with the specified NRIC was screened using the "find" command.
The "check" command makes some use of the "find" command. Every time the "find" command successfully finds a person, a line in the format of:
"NRIC timestamp" is printed in a text file called "ScreeningHistory.txt". The "check" command will read this file and retrieve the timestamps
corresponding to the specified NRIC. Below is an example of its usage:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 1: The user(a HQP) input his password and unlocks the system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 2: The user executes "check s1234567a" where the first argument is the command word "check" and the second is the NRIC to be checked which in is "s1234567a".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 3: The "check" command calls execute() which calls the getPersonWithNric() method. This method will read the ScreeningHistory.txt line by line, where each line
is in the format of "NRIC timestamp", for example "s1234567a 18/10/2018-20:38:42". Each line is split into the NRIC and timestamp. If line[0] is the NRIC specified,
the corresponding timestamp is stored in a list.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 4: The list from step 3 gets returned by execute() to create a CommandResult object which displays all the timestamps to the user.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>4a. "show unread" command</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once system is unlocked, regardless of which user you are, you can use this command. This command lists the new/unread messages in your inbox based on the password you used to unlock the system.
When messages are sent, they are stored inside a text file called "notifications_&lt;userID&gt;.txt", where 'userID' refers to the individual users.
It also implements the following operations:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>execute() - executes the "show unread" command itself and displays the result to the user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>getMessagesFor(String userId) - Searches the text file storing messages for the specific police officer identified by the userID and loads it into a data structure, sorting the messages according to how urgent they should be attended to (sorted first by read status, followed by priority and then the time the message was written).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>printMessages() - Displays messages on screen if the read status is unread.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following is an example usage scenario of the "show unread" command:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 1: The user input his password and unlocks the system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 2: The user executes "show unread" command. The "show unread" command calls execute() which also calls getMessagesFor() method.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 3: The getMessagesFor() method searches message storage file for the messages directed to the respective user, if any, and they are stored into a data structure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 4: The messages that are found and are stored in a TreeSet, split by its read status, message priority, timestamp, and the message itself for sorting purposes. execute() returns a CommandResult using the messages list as its argument.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 5: The CommandResult object displays to the user the number of unread messages he has, and the list of unread messages sorted according to their urgency.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Alternatives considered:
* Using a List instead of a TreeSet.
<strong> Pros: Smaller space complexity.
</strong> Cons: Less efficient code as 'sort' function must be called every time a new message is stored to maintain sorted order.
Eventually, we decided to use TreeSet in our implementation as we felt that the pros outweighed the cons. This becomes more obvious when the amount of data stored gets larger.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Using a single text file for storing messages, storing the userID of the recipient in the text file.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Fewer files to manage and filepaths to traverse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: Less efficient as it means more memory is required for storage per message stored (additional information of recipient of message required to be stored in the data structure itself when loaded).
Eventually, we also used multiple message storage files, each dedicated to a specific user, as this allowed us to increase the time efficiency of the code as the getMessagesFor() method did not need to sort through the messages based on recipient anymore. This benefit becomes especially obvious as well when there is a large number of messages that has to be stored, directed towards multiple users.</p>

</ul>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>3. Autocorrection feature</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Current Implementation</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The autocorrect mechanism is facilitated by use of dynamic programming.
The algorithm called EditDistance checks the number of single character
changes to be made to convert an invalid input into one expected by the
system. Currently, changes involving one single character can be corrected
by the system.
It implements the following operations:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>checkDistance() - It returns the edit distance needed to convert one
string to the other. In this case, it returns the number of single character
changes (either addition of a character, deletion of a character or changing
a character) to convert invalid user input into its most probable correct
implementation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>getCommands() - This function returns the list of possible commands that
the user can input.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following is an example usage scenario of the autocorrection feature:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 1: The user inputs his password and unlocks the system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 2: The user enters an invalid command.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 3: The system predicts the most probable intended command the user
would have wanted to input, based on a threshold and then prompts the user
to use the prediction given in its valid format.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The input is checked by the algorithm in the MainWindow before it is sent
to the Parser class. This is to ensure invalid input can be caught by the
algorithm to give its correction before it is deemed as invalid by the Parser
during which time all commands will be laid out to the user.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Alternatives considered-</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Running the algorithm from the Parser- This however will not allow the
prediction to be reported efficiently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Include predictions with more than one character changes- This will bring
in ambiguity in the correction algorithm and increases chances of errors.</p>
</li>
</ol>
