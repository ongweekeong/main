== PROJECT: Police Records and Intelligent System (PRISM)

---

== Overview

The Addressbook is morphed to a police records system called PRISM with two types of users, Police Officers (PO) & Headquarter Personnel (HQP).
Users have their own access levels with HQP having higher authorization compared to PO.
Police officers can screen civilians during duty with their respective NRIC, their criminal history and status would be shown to the police officers.
POs can also request for backup when needed, HQP would dispatch other POs at their discretion based on estimated time of arrival.
Refer to Quick Start guide to get started.

== Summary of contributions

* *Role*: Team Leader
* *Responsibility* : Deadlines
* *Major enhancements*: added *log in ability using only passwords* & *the ability for HQP to update any password* 
** *Password Accessibility* : allows HQP and PO to log into their respective profiles using just a password and without username. Once logged in, PO is not allowed to perform certain commands.
** *Update Password* : allows HQP to update any password, including PO passwords to new alphanumeric passwords with minimum length 5 characters.
** Justification: Since we don't want POs to alter the records, certain commands are disabled for them. The ability to update passwords regularly allows for greater security. 
The ability to lock anytime also helps to increase security in times of emergencies. Together, the features ensure a secure information-sensitive product.
** Highlights: Passwords had to be stored with encryption, and only allows user to enter incorrect passwords 5 times before shutting down.

* *Minor enhancement*: added a lock command that allows any user to lock (log out) the device immediately at any time.
